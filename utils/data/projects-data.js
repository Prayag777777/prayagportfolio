        description: 'This project addresses the rising concern of manipulated images by building a website that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect fake images. The system analyzes uploaded images to distinguish between authentic and tampered visuals. It features an intuitive interface where users can upload images or provide URLs for real-time analysis, providing accurate classification using deep learning.',

        description: 'A standalone application built to improve parking facility efficiency. It interacts with sensors and user interfaces to detect and display real-time parking space availability. The system tracks vehicle entry and exit times, calculates parking fees based on duration, and stores license plate data. It supports both administrators (for management and monitoring) and drivers (for finding spots and payments).',

        description: 'This project enables accurate measurement of object dimensions in real-time using OpenCV and ArUco markers for camera calibration. It addresses challenges posed by perspective distortion by using a reference marker to standardize measurements regardless of object distance or position. The system detects objects, calculates their dimensions in pixels, and converts them into real-world units using a pixel-to-cm ratio derived from the known size of the marker. The application supports both static images and live video input, offering real-time size measurements for multiple objects with high accuracy.',
